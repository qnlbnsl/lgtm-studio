# Replacing the website: the todo list

The owner approved the current mock as the reference and lifted the development
freeze for this build on 2026-11-08.
The scope is the complete visible screens.
The owner ruled on 2026-11-09 that the mock data layer, record shapes and fixtures are not contracts.
The approved simpler implementation is recorded in the unit plan.
The five build steps are an implementation order, not a reduced scope.

This list was reconciled against `master` at `5050be1` on 2026-11-08.
The source-to-mock map is `design/FEATURE-PARITY.md`.
The complete unit plan is `.plans/plans/website-replacement/plan.md`.
The main checkout also keeps a copy in `.scratch/foundry-runs/website-1/plan.md`.
The website team must not edit `design/`.

Each line below is one piece of work. "Agent's call" marks a choice the owner has
not ruled on.

## Engine: the data the mock shows

The engine is being extended through the `project` piece, with stored events,
commands, a client API section and agent tools.
The unit reports record which foundations have passed independent verification.
Unchecked items below still require their complete integration proof.

### Settings

- [ ] Store the workspace folder, which holds the owner's repositories. It is an
      owner-only setting. The installer will write it later.
- [ ] Store the defaults for a new project lead: harness, account, model, effort
      and permission. New project asks only for a repository and a name, so these
      must already exist. Agent's call.
- [ ] Store the owner's display name for the sidebar. It starts from git's
      `user.name`. Agent's call.

### Repositories, branches and changes

- [ ] List the repositories in the workspace folder, with name, path and project
      count.
- [ ] Create a brand new repository from New project: make the folder inside the
      workspace folder on the selected machine, run `git init`, and start on `main`.
      Report a name collision or a failure in a form the page can show.
- [ ] List a repository's branches and workspaces, with path, owner and activity,
      for the branch picker.
- [ ] Read a workspace's changes as a file tree, with added and removed line counts
      and the diff with line numbers. Unified and split views are drawn by the page.
      Give the reply a size limit.
- [ ] Read a branch's commit history, and the files and diff of one commit.
- [ ] Always create a dedicated worktree for each project. Remove the worktree
      checkbox, and always preview Branch and Folder. A safe form of the project
      name sets the branch and the folder, with a numeric suffix on a collision.
      Keep the repository main checkout recorded for the owner’s review and approval.
      Report git errors in a form the page can show.
- [ ] Record which machine each repository and workspace is on.

### Git writes

The mock's Git page changes the repository, so these are not reads. Each one reports
git's failure in a form the page can show.

- [ ] Stage and unstage a file, and commit with a message, on the workspace's branch.
- [ ] Fetch, pull and push the branch, with counts of commits ahead and behind.
- [ ] Merge a team's branch into its project's branch, and list the conflicts when it
      stops. Refuse the merge when the destination has uncommitted changes.
- [ ] Open a review from the project's branch to `main` or `master`. Only the owner
      credential may explicitly approve and merge, after revalidating both reviewed
      source and destination heads. Agents remain refused by the existing integration
      path. Allow the explicit Approve without evidence choice. Issue 545 supplies
      the bounded engine dependency before the engine gate.

### Projects and teams

- [ ] Add a project record: repository, name, goal, lead, assigned branch, checkout
      type, folder and machine.
- [ ] Refuse a second project with the same name in a repository, ignoring case.
- [ ] New project starts the lead with the stored defaults, in the project's
      dedicated worktree, and opens its conversation.
- [ ] Store each project's preferred shell for its terminal sessions.
- [ ] Choose each lead's name from a list. Agent's call.
- [ ] Enforce exactly one lead per project.
- [ ] Add a team record under a project, with a name and its agents. Reuse agent
      groups and group board channels, so team chat is the board.
- [ ] Tie every agent to its project and team, so the sidebar tree can be built.
- [ ] Show each agent's status: Needs you, Reviewing, Working or Ready. Reviewing
      and Working come from the agent's task.

### Sprints and tasks

- [ ] Add a sprint record: label such as SP-01, name, goal, phase, owner,
      dependencies, completion and evidence. The phases are the build loop's.
- [ ] Add a task record: label such as SH-12, title, owner, team, sprint, state
      and workspace. The states are up next, in progress, in review, blocked and done.
- [ ] Work out a sprint's column in one shared function, as the mock does: Planned,
      In progress, Review or Done.
- [ ] Refuse new tasks in a completed sprint.
- [ ] Let a sprint move to Done only with completion evidence. Keep release status
      separate.
- [ ] Record a task's history for its Work and handoff timeline.
- [ ] Tell the project lead when the owner adds a task. Agent's call.
- [ ] Let leads write sprints and tasks through agent tools, so the board works
      before the workflow runner exists.
- [ ] Let a worker change only its own tasks, and only in its own project.

### Decisions and conversations

- [ ] Extend a question with a title, a recommendation and a proposed answer. The
      mock's decision card shows all three.
- [ ] Link a question to its task and sprint. A linked task shows as blocked while
      the question is open.
- [ ] Answering a linked question marks its task done, as the mock does. A worker
      whose task should continue asks without the link. Agent's call.
- [ ] Surface an open decision in the project lead's conversation, the sidebar and
      the sprint. Only an answer clears it.
- [ ] Add a command to stop a reply without stopping the agent. The runner can
      already cancel a turn, but no command reaches it.
- [ ] Let the owner read a team channel without leaving read marks. Today a board
      read marks posts, so the page waits for a tap.
- [ ] Add context to a message from the composer's Add context control.

### Requests across projects

Home, the bell and the sidebar dots all read this.

- [ ] Add a durable index of the owner's open requests across all projects: questions
      and permissions, with project, agent, task and the time each was raised.
- [ ] Filter that index by kind and by project, for Needs attention, Questions and
      Approvals.
- [ ] Keep answered requests, so the page can show them after the answer.
- [ ] Work out how long each request has waited and which task it blocks.

### Terminal

- [ ] Run a real terminal on the selected machine and workspace, using the project's
      preferred shell. It runs commands directly, as the owner.
- [ ] Stream input and output, and support resize, interrupt and reconnect, with an
      owner for each session. Only the logged-in owner can attach.
- [ ] Use a real pseudo-terminal, so full-screen programs such as vim and agent command
      lines run, and resize reports columns and rows to the program.
- [ ] Choose how Node.js runs a terminal. This may be the first native dependency.

### Subscriptions

- [ ] Show each account's name, harness, machine, sign-in state, enabled state and
      active agent count. `accounts` and `shadowHome.ts` already separate accounts,
      and the page keeps that.
- [ ] Add a machine to each account.
- [ ] Let each conversation choose its subscription, and offer only the subscriptions
      that are ready for that harness.
- [ ] Sign in to a provider from the page, in that account's private login. The agent
      suggests running the harness's own login in a terminal session. Agent's call.

### Machines: one master and paired workers

The mock makes this part of the website, so it no longer waits until after it.

- [ ] Add a worker mode: the computer chooses Master or Worker, and a worker joins a
      master by its HTTPS address and a pairing code.
- [ ] Pair with an expiring code, and confirm on both computers. The owner approved
      a pairing code for machines on 2026-11-06, and chose that the website generates
      it. Web login stays one password.
- [ ] Add `lgtm connect <address>`, which starts the pairing from the other computer.
- [ ] Secure the link with a secure WebSocket and self-signed certificates that each
      side trusts after pairing, as the owner described on 2026-11-06.
- [ ] Have the worker connect out to the master, and report its capacity in agent
      slots, its repositories, its health and its identity.
- [ ] Place a project on a machine. Offline or unconfirmed workers get no new projects,
      and a worker cannot place projects. Moving running work is separate.
- [ ] Run agents through the same runner commands the engine uses locally, with the
      master's event log as the only record, and no duplicate work after a failure.
- [ ] Let an agent's LGTM Studio tools, the terminal and git reads reach the right machine.
- [ ] Rework who-is-calling checks, because the master cannot inspect a process on
      another machine.
- [ ] Decide how work moves between machines. Git through the shared remote is the
      obvious route.
- [ ] Handle a worker going away while its agents are working.

### Added by the designer's critique and the mock's data layer

The critique of 2026-11-06 changed these parts of the mock, and the data layer of 2026-11-07
proposes possible events. `design/data/README.md` on `area/web-mock` lists them.
Implement only the typed records needed by the visible behaviors; do not reproduce fixture shapes.

- [ ] Supply the typed project records that the visible screens need through the existing `project` piece.
- [ ] Read merge evidence per branch head: the test result and the review verdict.
- [ ] Let a retry after a failed start change the model and the effort.
- [ ] Add a command to change a machine's role, with its effect stated first.
- [ ] Name the machine in failure text, in `startFailure.ts`.
- [ ] Use the attention words Question, Approval, and Failed start, including in
      `alertTitles.approval`.

## Website: rebuild `packages/web` to match the mock

- [ ] Move the Field and Dusk tokens and the mock's styles into files, because the
      site's security policy blocks inline styles and scripts.
- [ ] Rewrite the mock's string-built views in React. Agent data stays plain text.
- [ ] Build the sidebar tree: repositories, projects with lead and branch, teams
      and agents, with chevrons separate from selection. Include the filter for only
      projects needing the owner.
- [ ] Build Home: Needs attention, All projects, Questions and Approvals, with one-line
      rows that expand in place and hand focus to the next row after an answer.
- [ ] Build the bell's popover, which counts the same requests as Home.
- [ ] Build the quick switcher.
- [ ] Build each repository's page. A repository name in the sidebar opens it, so there
      is no separate Repositories destination.
- [ ] Build the New project dialog, including its New repository option.
- [ ] Build panel resizing and remember each panel's width.
- [ ] Build the sprint board with its four columns and the empty board.
- [ ] Build the lead chat panel on the board: open, close, expand, and a drawer on
      smaller screens with Escape and contained focus.
- [ ] Build the sprint page and the task page, with evidence, dependencies and the
      timeline.
- [ ] Build the Add Task dialog.
- [ ] Build the conversation view: compact header, quiet owner turns, collapsed
      tool details and a growing composer that names its recipient.
- [ ] Build one tab row that keeps its position on every view: Board, Mocks when present, Chat,
      Terminal, Git, Project settings, and Tasks last in team scope. There is no Changes tab, because Git
      covers it. Remember the last tab.
- [ ] Build the Git view at full window height, with three columns that each scroll:
      worktrees, then the commit message above the file tree, then the diff. It has unified
      and split diffs, This file and All files, and commit history in the same pane.
- [ ] Build the Git actions: commit, fetch, pull, push, the conflict list, the team merge,
      the review to the main branch, and the block on a dirty destination.
- [ ] Build the branch picker. Picking a branch changes only what is viewed.
- [ ] Build the Terminal view with a terminal emulator such as xterm.js. It fills the
      main area below the tabs, with the prompt in the character grid and no input box. A
      slim bar holds the sessions, branch, machine and size in columns and rows.
- [ ] Build the Project settings tab: location and preferred shell.
- [ ] Build the Machines page in both modes, with its pairing dialog and project
      placement.
- [ ] Build the Subscriptions page, with its add and sign-in dialogs.
- [ ] Build the decision card and its links, down to the exact question.
- [ ] Keep each conversation's draft and reading position.
- [ ] Build the color mode switch, following the device until the owner chooses.
- [ ] Build mobile navigation with contained focus.
- [ ] Keep routes in the URL hash, including the alert links `/#/thread/<agentId>`.
- [ ] Leave out the mock's Design notes preview controls, its heavy sample and all its
      other sample data.

## Keep what the current page does

The mock now shows all of these. `design/FEATURE-PARITY.md` maps each to its source.

- [ ] Log in, log out, session expiry, rejected login and unavailable session. Entered
      secrets clear when the session ends.
- [ ] Connection state in the top bar. Reconnecting keeps the last view and drafts,
      and disables anything that changes state.
- [ ] Permission requests, showing the action input before the answer buttons, with
      hidden input, held requests and unconfirmed answers as separate states.
- [ ] Stopping and resuming an agent. Stopping cancels permissions and keeps questions.
- [ ] Failed-start reasons, which also prevent sending.
- [ ] Large thread items, with a loader, failure and retry.
- [ ] Tool calls and delivery history.
- [ ] The Alerts page as a table of notifications sent to the owner's phone, with paging,
      subject links and delivery failures. Its badge counts failed notifications only, and
      Home and the bell count the requests.
- [ ] The Settings page, with all twelve push kinds, the carrier and its write-only
      token, and the web server controls.

## Tests and proof

- [ ] Update the existing browser test files for the new page.
- [ ] Update `live-check-web.ts`, which finds elements by their current names.
- [ ] Port `design/checks.mjs`, `operations-checks.mjs`, `workspace-tools-checks.mjs`,
      `workspace-redesign-checks.mjs`, `home-checks.mjs`, `revision-checks.mjs` and
      `data-checks.mjs`, `onboarding-checks.mjs`, and `mocks-checks.mjs` to the browser suite at 390, 768, 1440 and 2560 pixels in both color modes.
- [ ] Add a real-agent proof: New project with a worktree, talk to the lead, the lead
      writes a sprint and a task, and a decision is answered from the board.
- [ ] Add real proofs for a terminal session running vim, a commit and merge from Git, a
      new repository, a provider sign-in and a worker on a second machine.
- [ ] Run `pnpm check`, `pnpm live-check:web` and `pnpm live-check` before merging,
      because stored events change.

## Attack list

These are on `.scratch/security/attack-todo.md` as what must hold.

- [ ] Git reads and the changes view.
- [ ] Git writes from the page, and creating a new repository.
- [ ] Who may write projects, sprints and tasks.
- [ ] Agent-written fields on the page.
- [ ] The terminal, worktree creation and provider sign-in.
- [ ] Pairing and the worker connection.


## Requirements added by the current mock on 2026-11-08

### First run and project lifecycle

- [ ] Implement the three resumable setup pages after login, with real computer discovery.
- [ ] Store positive setup completion and monotonic progress.
- [ ] Support scan retry, Back, missing-harness install instructions, and Change folder.
- [ ] Reuse New project for setup, with ready harness defaults and the latest repository.
- [ ] Persist the project goal, rename, archive, and restore.
- [ ] Stop the project's running agents before archive.
- [ ] Implement Add repository through Machines and preserve the New project draft on return.

### Project stages, mocks, and repository Design

- [ ] Store project stages and unique stage-derived team names, with optional area labels.
- [ ] Show the stage strip and the conditional Mocks tab.
- [ ] Read actual mock screens, revisions, scenarios, drafted fields, and components, with routes only for each screen's supported scenarios.
- [ ] Render optional caller-reviewed field comparisons and explicit Unavailable values without inferring an application schema.
- [ ] Record owner mock approval and its planning handoff.
- [ ] Show repository tokens and shared component previews in Design.
- [ ] Keep design-to-code conversion as later Build-team tooling.

### The current shell and responsive behavior

- [ ] Implement the remembered 48-pixel rail and its keyboard shortcut outside terminal focus.
- [ ] Use the current exact tab order, with Mocks conditional and Tasks last.
- [ ] Make breadcrumbs navigate without repeated page titles.
- [ ] Use the current typography, spacing, control heights, local fonts, and credited icons.
- [ ] Dock the selected thread beside every project view above 1800 pixels.
- [ ] Give duplicate request blocks unique anchors and focus the one answered.
- [ ] On phones, keep menu, place, and bell in the top bar and put connection details in the bell.
- [ ] Put Inspecting below the tabs on phones.
- [ ] Let the whole phone drawer scroll and put agents needing attention first.
- [ ] Render the phone board as one attention-first list.
- [ ] Stack responsive records with status first on their second line.
- [ ] Preserve overflow fades, readable breadcrumbs, and unwrapped avatar initials.

### Requests, composer, and service actions

- [ ] Sort failed starts first and then longest waits in Home and the bell.
- [ ] Mark waits of at least one hour in amber.
- [ ] Preserve answer result and time in history.
- [ ] Use one reusable block for questions, approvals, and failed starts.
- [ ] Put sprint requests before its goal and show approval-blocked tasks.
- [ ] Put timestamps on every task activity step.
- [ ] Send on Enter and use Shift+Enter for a line break.
- [ ] Open the context search with @ and preserve sent context references.
- [ ] Offer subscription, model, effort, and honest context usage beside the composer.
- [ ] Offer notifications at the first waiting request, outside setup.
- [ ] Persist Not now so that the offer never returns.
- [ ] Retry a failed notification and send a test notification through the real transport.
- [ ] Show subscription usage/reset where the provider reports them and unavailable state otherwise.
- [ ] Rename and remove subscriptions without combining their private logins.
- [ ] Rename and remove machines and leave a master with the stated effects.

### Git and terminal additions

- [ ] Stage all, unstage all, and discard with confirmation while preserving conflicts.
- [ ] Resolve each conflict in the diff pane with ours, base, and theirs.
- [ ] Persist selection and drafts per worktree and expose merge evidence by branch head.
- [ ] Support terminal session names, rename, close, paste, reconnect, and real program completion.
- [ ] Keep terminal output out of stored events and logs.

## The five ordered build gates

- [ ] Step 1: Engine data, including current first-run, service, stage, and mocks data.
- [ ] Step 2: Replace the page in React and pass the full browser parity matrix.
- [ ] Step 3: Real terminals and subscription sign-in.
- [ ] Step 4: Installer and `.lgtm` configuration.
- [ ] Step 5: Pairing, worker mode, remote runner, and final integration.

Each gate requires `pnpm check` and `pnpm live-check:web` from the website team.
The manager runs `pnpm live-check` from the manager shell at the gate commit.
The baseline is the manager's clean-checkout result of 19 stages out of 23.
Roles units 3, 4 and 11a remain unbuilt.
