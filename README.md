# LGTM Studio

LGTM Studio is a standalone program that runs teams of coding agents as a small
company. An orchestrator directs team leads, and each lead directs workers.
The agents coordinate through a strict message board.
The engine, board, authenticated application programming interface (API), and
web page are the core program.
The product's public site is [lgtmstudio.dev](https://lgtmstudio.dev).

An optional [Herdr plugin](plugins/herdr/README.md) connects the core program
to [Herdr](https://github.com/herdrdev/herdr) for terminal panes and future
interactive sessions.
The core runs without Herdr installed.
LGTM Studio ships a default workflow that people can override.

> [!WARNING]
> LGTM Studio is under development. The engine, authenticated client API, message

> permission rules remain unbuilt, pending the owner's harness recordings.
> Real-account and physical phone checks remain separate owner-run work. This

> planned work.

## Where LGTM Studio came from

LGTM Studio is inspired by [Herdr Synapse](https://github.com/vitalysim/herdr-synapse),
created by [Vitaly Simonovich](https://github.com/vitalysim). Synapse showed
that agents inside one Herdr session can work as a team: a shared board, a
human-owned charter, and a notifier that only speaks to an agent when it can
listen. LGTM Studio started as a fork of that idea and then took a different
direction, so it is a separate project with its own codebase.

Thank you, Vitaly, for building Synapse and for releasing it under the
Apache License 2.0.

The optional plugin uses Herdr to host terminal panes.

LGTM Studio borrows ideas, and some code, from
[T3 Code](https://github.com/pingdotgg/t3code) by T3 Tools Inc., released
under the MIT License. The code LGTM Studio uses from it is in
`third_party/t3code/`, and the [NOTICE](NOTICE) file lists every piece of
code taken from another project.

## What LGTM Studio is meant to provide

These are the intended pieces. Each one is tracked in more detail in
[docs/features.md](docs/features.md).

- **The foundry.** The backend that knows about orchestrators, team leads, and
  the different kinds of worker, and that starts, stops, and reassigns them.
- **A strict message board.** Channels per team, direct messages, and clear
  rules for who gets woken by which post. The board's first job is to save
  turns and tokens.
- **Threads.** Every agent's conversation is visible and steerable as a
  thread, in the spirit of [T3 Code](https://github.com/pingdotgg/t3code).
- **A client API.** One authenticated API that the web page, a future desktop
  app, and a future mobile app all use. Nothing a client can do is reserved
  for the terminal.

LGTM Studio comes with one default workflow, the
[build loop](docs/specs/2026-11-05-build-loop-design.md). Anyone who wants a
different workflow overrides it in `~/.lgtm`, or for one repository in that
repository's `.lgtm`. Particular team shapes (which teams exist, what each
role is told to do) are not part of LGTM Studio. They live elsewhere and are loaded
into it.

## Start LGTM Studio without Herdr

This checkout needs Node.js 26 and pnpm.
From the repository root, select Node.js and install the dependencies:

```sh
nvm use
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm --filter @lgtm/web build
```

Start the service with a web password in its environment:

```sh
read -rs LGTM_WEB_PASSWORD
export LGTM_WEB_PASSWORD
./bin/lgtm serve --detach
unset LGTM_WEB_PASSWORD
```

The `read` command above works in Bash and Zsh.
Enter a long, random password at its prompt, then press Enter.
Open `http://127.0.0.1:8787` and log in with that password.
The web password must contain at least eight characters.
The engine's default state folder is `~/.local/state/lgtm`.
Set `LGTM_HOME` on the service and command processes to use another folder.
The service continues running after the launching terminal closes.
The terminal thread viewer is available through `./bin/lgtm view`.

The rebuilt website, made from the mock in `design/mock/`, is served at `/studio/`.
Build it once from the repository root with `pnpm --filter @lgtm/studio build`.
Then open `http://127.0.0.1:8787/studio/` and sign in with the same web password.
It shows the engine's real records, but its actions are not connected to the engine yet.
See [design/mock/README.md](design/mock/README.md) for what it does and does not do.

The service command also works without a web password.
In that case, the authenticated Unix socket is available and the web server
stays off.
See [remote access](docs/remote-access.md) before using a proxy or a phone.
An installer, startup at login, and loading project configuration from
`.lgtm` are the next piece of work.
